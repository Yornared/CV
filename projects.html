    <p>
This project is a fully automated chessboard that physically moves pieces using a CoreXY gantry system, stepper motors, and an electromagnet. The board communicates wirelessly with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which interprets moves from the Lichess API and translates them into precise motor commands.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Built on a cost-effective CoreXY rail system, inspired by 3D printer mechanics for accuracy and simplicity.</li>
  <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Powered by stepper motor drivers, an electromagnet for moving pieces, and a custom-built chess clock with wireless communication via nRF24.</li>
  <li><strong>Software:</strong> A React-based web app connects the board to Lichess, tracks the game state, and generates movement scripts for the magnet. Special handling was implemented for knight jumps, castling, and captures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Play against AI or human opponents on Lichess while the board mirrors the moves in real time.</li>
  <li>Accurate calibration with corner sensors and automatic re-homing.</li>
  <li>Bluetooth connection for setup and control.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My contributions:</strong> I programmed the motor control system on the ESP32-S3, implemented Bluetooth Low Energy and webserver communication with the React app, and co-designed and assembled the CoreXY rail system and board hardware.</p>
