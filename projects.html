  <h2>Wizzard Chess: Automatic Chessboard</h2>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBQQEwoC7Qw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>
    This project is a fully automated chessboard that physically moves pieces using a CoreXY gantry system, stepper
    motors, and an electromagnet. The board communicates wirelessly with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which interprets
    moves from the Lichess API and translates them into precise motor commands.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Built on a cost-effective CoreXY rail system, inspired by 3D printer mechanics for
      accuracy and simplicity.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Powered by stepper motor drivers, an electromagnet for moving pieces, and a
      custom-built chess clock with wireless communication via nRF24.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Software:</strong> A React-based web app connects the board to Lichess, tracks the game state, and
      generates movement scripts for the magnet. Special handling was implemented for knight jumps, castling, and
      captures.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play against AI or human opponents on Lichess while the board mirrors the moves in real time.</li>
    <li>Accurate calibration with corner sensors and automatic re-homing.</li>
    <li>Bluetooth connection for setup and control.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>My contributions:</strong> I programmed the motor control system on the ESP32-S3, implemented Bluetooth Low
    Energy and webserver communication with the React app, and co-designed and assembled the CoreXY rail system and
    board hardware.</p>

  <h3>UniGigs: Gamified Freelancing SaaS for Universities</h3>
  <img src="images/unigig_landingPage.png" alt="UniGigs landingPage" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  
  <p>
    UniGigs is a <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> platform that enables freelancing 
    services within university communities. It integrates gamification elements such as token-based 
    transactions, login streak rewards, user levels, and leaderboards to drive engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Design & Features:</strong><br>
    • Dual-role system for service providers and seekers.<br>
    • Token-based currency with real money conversion.<br>
    • Gamification: login streaks, user levels, leaderboards.<br>
    • Real-time chat and notifications.<br>
    • Profile management and gig tracking.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Development Context:</strong><br>
    Built by a team of 5 members over 12 weeks. The platform uses a 
    <strong>React + TypeScript frontend</strong>, <strong>Firebase backend</strong>, 
    and <strong>Stripe integration</strong> for payments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>My Contributions:</strong><br>
    • Set up and managed the Firebase NoSQL database (initially planned with Dataconnect, but migrated due to beta limitations).<br>
    • Implemented the <em>My Posted Gigs</em> and <em>Schedule</em> tabs for managing gigs.<br>
    • Performed design cleanup to ensure consistency across views.<br>
    • Actively contributed to brainstorming features and shaping the overall design direction.<br>
